# Digital Geography for Seattle Car Collisions from 2018 to 2020

## Introduction
We have just passed the 2020 covid-19 pandemic. While looking forward to the popularization of vaccines, we are also thinking about the changes the epidemic has brought to people and how the epidemic will affect people's daily lives. As we have observed during the epidemic, when we go out and drive on the road, we can obviously feel that there are fewer vehicles on the road and the traffic volume has dropped drastically. The number of people driving cars seems to have been greatly reduced. So, does the reduction in traffic reduce traffic accidents? Will covid-19 affect traffic safety?

> "By the NSC's mark, 2020 is shaping up to be much deadlier for auto accidents than last year. The monthly mileage death rate jumped 26.1% in July 2020 compared to July 2019, according to the NSC, as fatality rates spiked despite the drop in miles driven. (The Rothenberg Law Firm LLP, 2020)"

#### A. Goal of the Project
The goal of this Seattle car collisions project comes from thinking about these road safety data. The project displays traffic collision data from 2018 to 2020 in the form of a smart dashboard. Its purpose is to visualize the changes in the number of car collisions and {==geographic locations==} in the Seattle area before and after covid-19 through digital geography, and spatially analyze urban traffic safety. In addition, spatially highlighted the road sections where car accidents frequently occur. Provide users with traffic safety information. At the same time, put forward the thinking about whether road safety, urban life, and so on are affected by covid-19.
